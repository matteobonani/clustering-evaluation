# Clustering Evaluation on the Wine Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates **clustering evaluation techniques**.
The notebook is designed for educational purposes.

The focus is on comparing three commonly used clustering evaluation metrics:

1. **Silhouette Score** – Measures how well each point fits within its own cluster relative to other clusters.
2. **Calinski–Harabasz Index (CH)** – Ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion; rewards global cluster separation.
3. **DBCV (Density-Based Clustering Validation)** – Measures density-based cluster separation; useful for non-globular clusters.
